## 2026-02-21 - Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation Overhaul
**Learning:** Converting non-semantic interactive `div`s to `button`s with a reset CSS class (`.btn-reset`) is a powerful way to improve accessibility (keyboard focus, screen reader announcements) without disrupting the visual design.
**Action:** Always check for `pointer` classes on `div`s or `span`s and consider refactoring them to semantic `button` elements with proper ARIA attributes.
