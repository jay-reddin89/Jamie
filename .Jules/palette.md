**Learning:** Transitioning from non-semantic elements (like divs) to semantic ones (like buttons) for interactive components significantly improves screen reader support and keyboard accessibility with minimal effort. Adding global listeners for 'Escape' and 'Enter' keys provides a more "native" app feel to web interfaces.
**Action:** Always check for clickable divs and replace them with buttons, and ensure modals and forms have appropriate keyboard shortcuts.
